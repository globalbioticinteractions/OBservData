Hi Nacho,
 
Please find attached the datasets from the Kleijn et al. 2015 paper. Apologies for the delay.
 
I have only included datasets when the first author of the dataset was on the list you sent me. This means that a number of datasets from Claire Kremen’s group, Yael Mandelik’s group and colleagues of Ruan Veldtman have not been included. Note that while I included Taylor Rickets data, these data do not have spatial coordinates, so I assume they are pretty useless to you. For the same reason the data from Hungary, which I extracted myself from the literature, are not included as the authors didn’t report the locations where the specimens had been collected.
 
Also check carefully for overlap between the data that you receive from Romina, Lucas and me. Some of the datasets have been used in two or maybe all three studies.
