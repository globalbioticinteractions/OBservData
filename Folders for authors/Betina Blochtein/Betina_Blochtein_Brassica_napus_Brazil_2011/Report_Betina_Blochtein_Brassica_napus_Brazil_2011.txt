- Please check that credit information is correct and add the corresponding affiliations and acknowledgements in the following Gdocs: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NfGDWqrAuPECfjJ3ZwqosS9zeigLoG021yJewUaAWQ8/edit?usp=sharing

- If your study is already published, please check that its DOI is correct.

- According to our raw data, there is not enough taxonomic resolution to estimate richness. Please, check that such information is correct. See also the information about OBServ data processing in your General Report.

- Please, check that the brief description of your methodology (in your insect_sampling file) is correct.

- We assumed that all dipterans belong to other_flies guild. Besides, notice that results for flower-visitor density (no. flower visitors in 100 flowers), and flower-visitor richness (no. species in 30 minutes) are different from those in Garibaldi's supplementary material (Science, 2016).
