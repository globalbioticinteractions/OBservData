Hi Blande,

Thanks for the clarifications. Good to know that only the Xylocopa species contribute to 
pollination.

I will be in touch again when I have some results.

Cheers,

David.

Hi David 
The geographic coordinate system is South America Datum - SAD 69. I think we can assume the 
less abundant Xylocopa species made up at least 5% of the total visits. I just would like to 
tell you that the Passion fruit pollinator are the big Xylocopa bees. T spinipes and A mellifera are 
considering a nectar robber. 
Cheers

Hi Blande,
 
This is really excellent, thanks. I did a quick scan. Xylocopa spp. make up c. 47% of the 
total number of bees (including Apis; excluding Apis even more). Is it safe to assume that 
visits of the less abundant Xylocopa species made up at least 5% of the total visits? That 
way we can list both Xylocopa species and the Trigona species as dominant species in your 
dataset.
 
Could you also let me know what geographic coordinate system you used?
 
I will keep you informed about progress with the analysis/manuscript. I will probably work in 
force on this the last couple of months of the year (still busy collecting datasets).
 
All the best,
 
David.

Hi David,
Sorry again for delay. I`really very busy lately. I´m sending to you the complete Passion fruit 
data including 03 columns with total number of specimens per  50m transect (~90 flowers in a 
trasect of 50m).  All non Apis bees has more than 100 specimens.  
Xylocopa spp is two species: Xylocopa Megaxylocopa frontalis Olivier and Xylocopa 
Neoxylocopa grisescens Lepeletier, the last one was more abundant. But as they are very similar 
morphologically, separate one from the other visiting the flowers was hard, so we chose to 
consider only the taxonomic level of genus, to avoid mistakes. 
Cheers 
Blande
