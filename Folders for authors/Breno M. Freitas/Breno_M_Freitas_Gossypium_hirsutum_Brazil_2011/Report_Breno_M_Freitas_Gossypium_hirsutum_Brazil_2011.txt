- If your study is already published, please check that its DOI is correct.

- If possible, please provide the names of missing crop varieties.

- If possible, please provide the sampling start month and sampling end month for each field, respectively, and use a numeric format (for example, 1 for January, 2 for February and so on).

- If possible, please provide the latitude and longitude of the missing locations.

- There are sites without visitation rate records. Please, check that such information is correct. See also the information about OBServ data processing in your General Report.

- According to our raw data, there is not enough taxonomic resolution to estimate richness. Please, check that such information is correct. See also the information about OBServ data processing in your General Report.

- Please, check that the brief description of your methodology (in your insect_sampling file) is correct.

- Our raw data provide information for two sites. However, in Garibaldi et al. 2015, there is a system with the same features that report results for 20 fields. Are the latter and the former the same study? If so, why is the number of sites different?
