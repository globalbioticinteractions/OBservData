- If your study is already published, please check that its DOI is correct.

- If possible, please provide the names of missing crop varieties.

- If possible, please provide the sampling start month and sampling end month for each field, respectively, and use a numeric format (for example, 1 for January, 2 for February and so on).

- There are sites without visitation rate records. Please, check that such information is correct. See also the information about OBServ data processing in your General Report.

- According to our raw data, there is not enough taxonomic resolution to estimate richness. Please, check that such information is correct. See also the information about OBServ data processing in your General Report.

- There are sites without yield. Please, check that such information is correct. If possible, please provide the missing values (or the corresponding z-scores).

- There are sites without their alternative yield values. Please, check that such information is correct. If possible, please provide the missing values (or the corresponding z-scores).
