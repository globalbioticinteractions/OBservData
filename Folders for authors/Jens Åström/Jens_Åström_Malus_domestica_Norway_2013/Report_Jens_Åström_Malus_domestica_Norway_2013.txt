- If your study is already published, please check that its DOI is correct.

- If possible, check the latitude and longitude that were included in your field_level_data (csv) file. According to our automatic tests, some locations do not belong to the reported country/countries.

- There are sites without abundance records. Please, check that such information is correct. See also the information about OBServ data processing in your General Report.

- There are sites without visitation rate records. Please, check that such information is correct. See also the information about OBServ data processing in your General Report.

- There are sites without richness estimations. Please, check that such information is correct.

- Please check that our information about your recorded taxa (or taxa constraint) is correct.

- Please, check that the brief description of your methodology (in your insect_sampling file) is correct.


- We assumed that visit to 100 flower were measured for 5 minites in each field. J.A. richness estimations for each field refers to the average richness per round. Here we use total richness for four rounds. Unidentified bees were remove from abundance and richness calculations (10 over 202 observations).
