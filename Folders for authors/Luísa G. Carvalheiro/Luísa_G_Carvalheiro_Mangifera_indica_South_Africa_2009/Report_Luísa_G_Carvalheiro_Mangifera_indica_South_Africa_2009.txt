Year of sampling: 2009

Crop: Mangifera indica

Variety: Full information.

Location: Full information.

Country: All reported countries are OK.

Field size: There are missing field sizes (given 0 out of 31).

Management: Full information.

Sampling period: There are missing sampling periods.

Richness: There are missing values (given 15 out of 31).

Taxa constraint: No taxa restrictions have been identified.

Abundance: There are missing values (given 15 out of 31).

Visitation rate: There are missing values (given 0 out of 31).

Yield units: early fruit set

Yield: There are missing values (given 14 out of 31).

Queries
====================================================
Instructions: Please, edit this file and answer the

====================================================

- Please check that credit information is correct and add the corresponding affiliations and acknowledgements in your 'Author_template'.

- If your study is already published, please check that its DOI is correct.

- If possible, please provide the area of each field [in hectares].

- If possible, please provide the sampling start month and sampling end month for each field, respectively, and use a numeric format (for example, 1 for January, 2 for February and so on).

- There are sites without abundance records. Please, check that such information is correct. See also the information about OBServ data processing in your General Report.

- There are sites without visitation rate records. Please, check that such information is correct. See also the information about OBServ data processing in your General Report.

- There are sites without richness estimations. Please, check that such information is correct.

- Please check that our information about your recorded taxa (or taxa constraint) is correct.

- There are sites without yield. Please, check that such information is correct. If possible, please provide the missing values (or the corresponding z-scores).

- There are sites without their alternative yield values. Please, check that such information is correct. If possible, please provide the missing values (or the corresponding z-scores).

- Please, check that the brief description of your methodology (in your insect_sampling file) is correct.

- Notice that carv03_Bavaria_L_FA1 is repeated. Two values of crop yield (denoted here as yield2) were assigned to such site. We replaced such value by the site mean value for yield.
