Queries (answer in line one by one)
===================================

- Please check that credit information is correct and add the corresponding affiliations in the following Gdocs: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NfGDWqrAuPECfjJ3ZwqosS9zeigLoG021yJewUaAWQ8/edit?usp=sharing

- If your study is already published, please check that its DOI is correct.

- If possible, please provide the area of each field [in hectares].

- If possible, please assign a management category [organic, IPM, conventional] to each field.

- If possible, please provide the sampling start month and sampling end month for each field, respectively, and use a numeric format (for example, 1 for January, 2 for February and so on).

- If possible, please provide the latitude and longitude of the missing locations.

- There are sites without abundance records. Please, check that such information is correct. See also the information about OBServ data processing in your General Report.

- Please, check that the brief description of your methodology (in your insect_sampling file) is correct.

- If possible, please, provide yield information.

- To calculate the visitation rate (flowers vitited per unit of time) of each guild, we aggregated the visitation rates of its corresponding organisms. Is it fine? We have no information on the number of days in which coffee was in flower. Thus, it was not possible to estimate total sampling time, etc.
