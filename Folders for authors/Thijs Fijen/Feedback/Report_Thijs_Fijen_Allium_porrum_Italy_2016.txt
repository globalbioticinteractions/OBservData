Publication: NA https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13150

Number of sites: 18

Year of sampling: 2016

Crop: Allium porrum

Variety: There are missing varieties (given 0 out of 18). The five lines can be seen as varieties. There was differential response to different pollinators and crop yield differed markedly. Better to not aggregate. 

Location: There are missing locations (given 0 out of 18). Cannot be given due to confidentiality, but southern Italy. 

Country: There are no locations to check.

Field size: There are missing field sizes (given 0 out of 18). Cannot be given due to confidentiality.

Management: Full information.

Sampling period: Full information.

Richness: Full information.

Taxa constraint: No taxa restrictions have been identified. Bees, syrphids and wasps

Abundance: Full information.

Visitation rate units: visits per 100 flowers and hour

Visitation rate: Full information.

Yield units: z-score Seeds produced (average of female lines)

Yield: Full information.

Alternative yield units: z-score Seed set (%, average of female lines)

Alternative yield: Full information.

====================================================

- Please check that credit information is correct and add the corresponding affiliations and acknowledgements in your 'Author_template'.

- If your study is already published, please check that its DOI is correct. done

- If possible, please provide the names of missing crop varieties. Done

- If possible, please provide the area of each field [in hectares]. Not done

- If possible, please provide the latitude and longitude of the missing locations. Not done

- Please check that our information about your recorded taxa (or taxa constraint) is correct. Checked, and improved.

- Please, check that the brief description of your methodology (in your insect_sampling file) is correct.

- When processing your raw data, we aggregated the measurements of the different female lines (i.e., yield, abundance, etc.). Is it correct? No.. I would consider the parent lines as varieties.
