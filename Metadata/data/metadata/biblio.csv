CropPol,"CropPol is a dynamic and open global database on crop pollination. It contains measurements recorded within 158 crop studies, covering 2,786 field observations, 2,115 yield measurements, and 25,183 insect records from 41 commercial crops, distributed throughout the globe. Most studies (149) and crops (34) are among the leading pollinator dependent global crops and commodities. Indeed, the impact of pollinators on increasing production is essential in 23 systems, great in 75, little in 8, modest in 43, and unknown in 10. Malus domestica is the most represented crop (25 systems), followed by Brassica napus (16 systems), Vaccinium corymbosum (13 systems), and Citrullus lanatus (12 systems). The most abundant pollinator guilds recorded are honey bees (32.37% counts/visits), bumblebees (18.79%), flies other than Syrphydae and Bombyliidae (15.84%), beetles (13.20%), other wild bees (9.68%), and syrphids (5.24%). Locations comprise 30 countries distributed among the Americas (66 systems), Europe (60), Asia (16), Oceania (10), and Africa (7). The sampling spans over three decades and concentrates on 2001-05 (15 systems), 2006-10 (29), 2011-15 (72), 2016-20 (40).",NA,NA,"Pollination, crop production, agricultural management, biodiversity, bees",NA,NA,"The sampled locations span over 30 countries distributed among North and South America (66 studies), Europe (60), Asia (16), Oceania (10), and Africa (7).",-75.60460,-122.97,59.86528,176.3204,NA,1990,2020
