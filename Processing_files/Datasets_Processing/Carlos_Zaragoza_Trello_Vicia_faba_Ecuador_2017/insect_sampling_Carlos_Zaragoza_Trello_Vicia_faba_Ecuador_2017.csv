We conducted pollinator surveys along 25 days (from early July to middle August) by walking during 15 minutes along each of two 150 x 1 m standardized transects per site. One transect was located at the field edge while the central transect was located at 25 m inside the field from the edge. In 5 fields these transects were adapted to the middle of the field as the field did not reach 50 meters. Transect walks were conducted between 8:00 and 16:30, low wind speeds and temperatures above 15 degrees C. Due Andean high altitude weather characteristics, during shorts periods of rain (minutes) or low clouds we stopped the survey and resumed it when weather allowed. Sites were surveyed thrice in random order. We surveyed all honeybees, bumblebees, solitary bees, hoverflies and other Diptera (e.g: Calliphoridae, Tachinidae, Sarcophagidae) that visited flowers inside Faba beans field and at the margin of the crop capturing the pollinators with a net. Handling time invested in capturing pollinators was discounted. In total, the sampling effort was 90 minutes. Pollinators that were easily identifiable (e.g. honeybees and Bombus funebris, medium and big hoverflies) were recorded without capturing when possible.",Round number: 1.
