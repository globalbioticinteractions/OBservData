Hi Taylor,

A single species pool for Costa Rica is fine. It would be great if you (Terry) can provide the 
identity of the species. It would allow me to include your data in an additional analysis. If 
that is not available I will happily settle for the total number. 

Cheers,

David.

hi David,

See below for my email thread with Terry Griswold about costa rica regional species pools.  is a 
single pool for costa rica good enough?  Terry has regionalized his sampling, but the specific 
region from my study seems lightly sampled.

want the country-wide numbers?  and total numbers are good enough, yes?  not identities of each 
species?

thanks1

OK.  What is the pool for CR overall?  That may be "regional" for this use!  thanks!

Don’t have lots from there.  96 species (some of which are morpho) based on 326 specimens. Our well

Hi Taylor,
 
Good to hear from you.  I have some regional pools for CR.  Where was the crop study done?

see below for a meta-analysis going on.  Do you know about any available 
regional species pool for CR bees?  I figured you might be the man to ask...
 
hope all's well!

Dear all,
 
Some time ago (for some of you: a very long time ago) I contacted you to 
obtain bee datasets on crop flowers. That fact that you have received this 
email means that you have kindly provided me with one or more datesets, for 
which I am truly gratefull.
 
This email is to give you a short update on where we stand with the datasets 
and the analyses and what the approximate time schedule is for the writing of 
the paper. Basically, therefore, it is to let you know that something is actually 
being done with your data. Progress is slow as I have other obligations which 
always seem to be a bit more urgent. Fortunately, I have help from a 
colleague, Diedert Spijkerboer, who is doing much of the data handling. Also 
the last few datasets still need to be obtained and it makes no sense to do 
analyses with incomplete datasets.
 
I currently have over 80 study units (crop*year*region combinations). Most of 
them from Europe and North America, but also a fair share from other parts of 
the globe. The mailing list is pretty indicative. I have done some preliminary 
analyses with the European data because of reporting obligations to the EU 
(the funder of the STEP project; report is not publicly available). These results 
were already interesting so I can’t wait to see whether they are being 
confirmed by the analyses of data from other continents.
 
The planning is to start doing proper analyses in May and June and start doing 
the writing after the summer break in September/October. So by the end of 
October you can expect a first draft of the manuscrtipt and a final manuscript 
should be submitted before the end of the year. I think this is doable.
 
In the meantime I will start pestering you for additional information. To start 
right away: one factor that seems to be important is the total species pool of 
bees that can be expected in a study region. For example in New Zealand 
there are only 26 species of bees (right Brad?) but in the Netherlands there 
are 358 species. So this an additional factor that could explain why we have 
observed more dominant bee species in the Netherlands than in New Zealand.
 
So if this type of information is available, please let me know for your 
country/state/province/bundesland how many species of bees you have. If 
you have a full species list, please send it to me or send me a link to a website 
that contains the list. If the information is not available: let me know. North-
Americans: you can skip this exercise as I understand that the situation is 
complex and data is scattered. For North-America I will contact some key 
people to explore what is possible.
 
Thanks for your help with this. I think this will become an interesting paper.
 
All the best,
 
David.
