Hi Taylor,

Many thanks for the clarification. This solves the issues. Will be in touch with the occasional 
update.

Cheers,

David.

Hi David,

I just looked again, and the data I sent you are the same as those I sent Lucas.  He has all the 
same sites you have (I had thought his were a subset, but no - he has them all too).

Trigoisca sp. is one species as far as we could tell.  We couldn't get it ID'd to species, but it is not 
an intentionally lumped category.

Native-summ, on the other hand, is a lumping of 13 morphospecies, each seen only a total of 
once or twice during the 2 year study.  I think you could safely exclude those.

hope this helps!  And thanks for including me.

Hi Taylor,
 
Thanks for the positive response. Is the dataset you sent me the dataset Lucas also has?
 
We might have a problem with the taxa that were not identified to species level in particular 
the Trigonisca sp. as they make up more than 10% of the specimens. Were these multiple 
species? For the purpose of our study that could be problematic since we need to identify 
the species contributing at least 5% to the total number of flower visits.
 
Also what does Native-summ indicate?
 
Assuming we can solve these issues I’m happy to include you as co-author and would 
welcome comments in the draft stage.
 
Cheers,
 
David.

Hi David,
 
First, great idea!  Second, yes you may use the data that Lucas has already for my coffee 
study.  Third, I have some additional sites for which Lucas does not have data (unpublishded, but 
also for coffee in Costa Rica in the same landscape).  I'll dig those up and get them to you.  You'll 
be able to tell the new ones by the site codes.  Finally, I'd love to be included as an author, and 
am happy to help draft/comment on the manuscript if this makes this more appropriate than just 
supplying unpublished data.

Dear Taylor,
 
I’m one of the participants of the European STEP-project that investigates Status and Trends 
of European Pollinators.
 
One of the things we aim to investigate within the project is the importance of species 
identity for crop pollination. In this study we take a global perspective. A number of studies 
have highlighted the importance of species-rich pollinator communities for pollination 
quantity and quality. Other studies however, find that most visits to crop flowers were done 
by just one or a few pollinator species. Most studies to date have however not examined in 
any detail which species were found on what crops.
 
In this study we want to identify the dominant species for crop pollination. Focussing on 
bees, we want to know which species most frequently visit what crop species and how this 
varies with time and space. Flower visitation will be used as a proxy for crop pollination. The 
lead authors of this study are Rachael Winfree, Luisa Carvalheiro and myself.
 
Because what we are doing is basically a study of studies we are looking for as many 
datasets as possible that we might be able to use. Our data requirements are relatively 
simple. We want to have frequency distributions of bee species on crop flowers (pan trap 
data are unfortunately not suitable). Preferably at the site level as this provides us with 
information on spatial variation on the geographic origin of the data. For analyses, we intend 
to use aggregated data across studies. So if it is the only thing you have, data at the study 
level would also be usable.
 
I have been told that you have supplied Lucas Garibaldi with data from your 2004 papers on 
bees in coffee in Costa Rica that could be useful for our study as well. Would you be ok for 
us to use that data? If you approve, we could get them from Lucas, so this would mean no 
additional work for you.
 
In general we are interested in any data that qualifies the criteria below. Both published and 
unpublished data are suitable. Data-owners of unpublished data automatically become co-
authors (unless they prefer not to), data-owners of published data become co-authors if 
they feel their contribution merits this. Perhaps you have any additional data that could be 
used in this study?
 
Criteria for studies suitable for inclusion are:
-       Per study a minimum of 4 separate sites were sampled
-       Sites are considered to be separate sites if they are at least 1 km apart.
-       Per study a minimum of 100 specimens of wild bees collected/observed (in countries 
with feral honey bees these qualify as wild bees)
-       Analyses will be done with and without honey bees, so please include honey bees 
whenever available.
-       All specimens identified to species level (lack of identification of some minor species 
may be acceptable).
-       Preferably: per study some information on sampling approach (e.g. by referring to a 
paper or a short description)
-       Geographic coordinates for each site.
 
We really hope you are interested (and have the time!) to help us with this.
 
If you have any questions don’t hesitate to ask. Looking forward to your response.
 
Thanks in advance and best wishes,
 
David Kleijn.
