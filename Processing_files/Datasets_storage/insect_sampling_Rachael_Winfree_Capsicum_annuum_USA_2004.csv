Pollinator visitation rate to flowers was measured during 45-s scans of flowers at 40 equally spaced points along the transect. We counted and then observed visits to as many flowers as we could view simultaneously within an approximately 1 x 1-m area

We counted and then observed visits to as many flowers as we could view simultaneously within an approximately 1 x 1-m area
